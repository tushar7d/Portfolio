# Proffesional Experience

## Expedia - Since Feb 2018

At Expedia, I have helped build and improve the car rental product, by improving the customer experience across the path. The focus being to simplify the product and provide clarity and consistency to the information across different suppliers.

I have also been involved with Design Operations projects to Improve the Design workflow by designing and developing custom tools such as Figma plugins, Prototyping toolkits etc.

Additionally, as a Design systems champ for the Cars Team I have worked closely with the Design systems team to bring cohesion across our products line for a seamless and unified user experience.

## Hike - Jun 2017 - Feb 2018

For the Short period I was at Hike, I helped build the first social payment platform in India, with pilot projects like blue packets, and the hike payment wallet based on UPI Payments technology.

I was also responsible for their user retention focused projects such as their Reward program and Content Seeding Projects (monetised content).

Although a short stint but the experience here was very rewarding.

## MakeMyTrip - Jun 2015 -  Jun 2017

MakeMyTrip was my first real product company and a great learning experience. By the end of my 2 years there I had helped define our Visual language and a design system to support it. This included a sketch based component library, documentation and usage discussion forums.

Before that as the sole member of the “Horizontals Team” I ReDesigned the entire Storefront and post sales experience for MakeMyTrip.

## FrogWalksOut - Jun 2014 -  Jun 2015

This was my first job, A small Design Studio with some fantastic clients such as G.s.k, Nascom to name a few. I was part of their Web design Team working on Quirky campaign pages to full featured interactive websites.

I got my first taste of product design when we built a product called “RealTimeEmails” which was basically a Drag and drop Marketing email editor which could send email with Dynamic content based on their proprietary Technology. I worked closely with my mentor Amit Sharma( who taught me what UX and product design really meant) to build out the entire project from scratch.
